# Architectural Basics

### Order of concepts:
1. Kernels and how do we decide the number of kernels?

2. 3x3 Convolutions
3. Receptive Field
4. How many layers
5. MaxPooling
6. Position of MaxPooling
7. The distance of MaxPooling from Prediction
8. 1x1 Convolutions
9. Learning Rate
10. Number of Epochs and when to increase them
11. Concept of Transition Layers
12. Position of Transition Layer
13. How do we know our network is not going well, comparatively, very early
14. When to add validation checks
15. Image Normalization
16. SoftMax
17. Batch Size, and effects of batch size
18. Batch Normalization
19. The distance of Batch Normalization from Prediction
20. DropOut
21. Adam vs SGD
22. LR schedule and concept behind it
23. When do we introduce DropOut, or when do we know we have some overfitting
24. When do we stop convolutions and go ahead with a larger kernel or some other alternative
