# Architectural Basics

### Order of concepts:
1. Kernels and how do we decide the number of kernels?
3x3 Convolutions,
Receptive Field,
How many layers,
MaxPooling,
Position of MaxPooling,
The distance of MaxPooling from Prediction,
1x1 Convolutions,
Learning Rate,
Number of Epochs and when to increase them,
Concept of Transition Layers,
Position of Transition Layer,
When to add validation checks
Image Normalization,
SoftMax,
Batch Size, and effects of batch size
Batch Normalization,
The distance of Batch Normalization from Prediction,
DropOut
Adam vs SGD
LR schedule and concept behind it
How do we know our network is not going well, comparatively, very early
When do we introduce DropOut, or when do we know we have some overfitting
When do we stop convolutions and go ahead with a larger kernel or some other alternative (which we have not yet covered)
